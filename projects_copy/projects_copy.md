# Calmer Internet
-------------------
### *Release Date: 17th August 2021*

A web extension that hides the elements of web pages that are best off hidden.
Many sites are designed to suck time away from you by showing you things that are interesting enough to keep you scrolling but offers no value.

This extension strips away all these comments, recommendations and promotions leaving you with just the content you have specifically asked to receive.

# Type or Die
------------------
### *Release Date: 5th March 2021*

Made in 5 days for the Newcastle University Computing and Technology Society (NUCATS) Game Jam, in which it received 3rd place.
It is a top-down zombie wave shooter where it's not your aim that matters but how fast you can type.

# Dice-Jack
-------------------
### *Release Date: 23rd September 2019*

Made in 2 days as a mini-project for a course. Used as a way to get to grips with windows forms and learn some Visual
Basic .NET. Just so happens to also be the first game of mine with a computer controlled player.

# Ping!
-------------------
### *Release Date: 23rd June 2018*

A remake of the classic Pong game. This was the first game I programed in Unity and as a result is pretty simple and
isnâ€™t very fleshed out but a vital learning experience in how to make a video-game as well as the the nuances and
functions of the Unity Editor.

# Fallen Stars
------------------------
### *Release Date: 16th April 2017*

This was my first attempt at a video-game and was done well before any other projects. It was made in Construct 2 so no
actual programming was involved but it was the first time I had designed a game from scratch and was a vital learning
experience. It was also a game I did very little of the art for and relied heavily on [opengameart.org](https://www.opengameart.org) which is a great
source of assets for those who are more focused on programming than art.

The game itself is an asteroids clone with a cartoon atmosphere and explosion animations that I was far too proud of at
the time. It even has a (barely) working high score system.
