</blockquote>
<p>For the past 5 days I have done what I have failed to do many times before,
complete the process of making a game.</p>
<p>The game was for the NUCATS Game Jam. NUCATS is the Newcastle University Computing
and Technology Society. It was made in Unity (with great help from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Brackeys</a>),
and it was really the first reasonably sized game I&rsquo;ve made. The only other thing I&rsquo;ve ever made in Unity was <a href="/8" rel="">Ping</a>
which, as the name suggests, was a pong clone.</p>
<p>Type or Die is a top-down zombie shooter where it is not about how good
your aim is, but how fast you can type. Waves of zombies come at you in all directions, with the direction
they come from determining what key to press to shoot at them (e.g a zombie coming from the top right would be shot at
using the &lsquo;p&rsquo; key).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The game jam has come in a time between some pretty busy weeks so I have surprised myself by actually getting a
finished game out. I even contemplated not taking part at all after the first day because I felt I just wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it.
I started off (as optimistic idiots often do) full of goals with zero plans. Every step of the way I was decreasing scope
to match my skill and enthusiasm, and its where those paths crossed that the game was made. I knew that the most complex
thing I could make in the time with limited skill was a 2d, single-screen game. Guns are an easy way to make the mundane exciting,
so the game became a shooter, and wanting to have the computer do all the work for you meant that it became a wave shooter for
replayability.</p>
<p>Every waking moment from Monday to Thursday was spent either watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632701/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Suits</a>
or making this game, and the sheer intensity of such an endeavour in the middle of some pretty hectic University team projects
made me realise one thing, I will probably not make another game for a very long time. If you have a gander at my <a href="/projects" rel="">projects</a> page
you will see that all of them are game, so you may think that I really enjoy game-making. But in retrospect I think I only made games as
an outlet for programming rather than an outlet for artistic ideas. Creation is a painful process, so you have to see the purpose in it.
As much as I am proud of what I achieved with each of the games I made, I can&rsquo;t see them as providing a service.</p>
<p>My perspective on games has completely changed in the past year, I place a huge value on the incredible narrative experiences offered by the likes of &lsquo;God of War&rsquo; or
&lsquo;The Beginners Guide&rsquo;, these are games made by people with something to say and the skill to say it. There is certainly a place for arcade
shooters, but if I don&rsquo;t feel passionate about the things I create then I will never see them as worth the time I put into them.</p>
<p>Type or Die marks the end of the 4-year-long adventure that started this whole blog off, I suppose it is fitting that it should end with another
top down arcade shooter. The game is pretty fun, the zombie death animations are my favourite part (also an original theme made by my musically inept hand).</p>
<p>More projects lie on the horizon, and the times they are a changin'.</p>

    <title>Inspection &amp; Dissection: Dice-Jack</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/static/postimages/10/dicejack1.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>As part of a course we had to make a game in 2 days that involved random dice and be made as a Windows forms application with Visual Basic. So we had to make a game in something that was the furthest you could get from a game engine with a language I had never used before. But hey, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Rogue</a> was made in 1980 and the graphics had to be ASCII so it could be worse.</p>
<p>The rest of the class generally stuck to the brief with 3 dice that you rolled and you got points for each dot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As you can see, its rather simple. Theres 4 picture boxes, 4 labels, 2 buttons and a listbox. Dice are rolled, the dots are added up and the score is added to the listbox. After 5 rolls the game ends and the player is given their total score. But to know how I added further features we need to look at how this prototype was made.</p>
<h1 id="behind-the-prototype">Behind the prototype</h1>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">

</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>So we have our variables declared in the convoluted VB way. Die1, Die2, and Die3 and the scores for the corresponding dice. DicePoints is the total of those 3 scores and rollcount keeps track of how many times the dice were rolled. Random is just an object we use to generate random numbers</p>

</div><p>On the board is a timer (inventfully called tmrTimer), it tick every 0.1s. Each tick it adds a bit onto the load bar at the bottom and randomizes the images on the dice. MatchImage is my own subroutine but all it does is take an integer and applies the correct face for it to whichever picture box I pass it.</p>
<p>Once the bar gets to 100, the fun begins.</p>

</div><p>Then we check whether they have reached the magic 5 rolls, if so we tell them their score and let them reset the game</p>
<p>There is also some initialisation code that assigns images and there are event handlers that make the buttons work but this is the main logic. If you would like to see how that stuff works, you can find it at the <a href="https://github.com/LukeBriggsDev/Dice-Alpha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">github repo</a></p>
<h1 id="the-evolution">The Evolution</h1>
<p>The following won’t include too many code snippets since it is slightly more extensive (the rushed deadline also means it resembles a tin of Heinz spaghetti in a tumble dryer but we’ll keep that between us)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lets break this down.</p>
<p>First we have a background that was shamelessly made in powerpoint.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The rules, scores, and title are all labels. The bar on the right is made up of the same button and listbox items as before but with its properties edited to change colour, font and border style.</p>
<p><strong>The Rules have been changed to the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to get as close to 21 points without going over</li>
<li>There is a Player and a Dealer</li>
<li>Each contestant has 2 dice</li>
<li>The player goes first</li>
<li>Each dice spot is worth 2 points</li>
<li>If either the player or dealer goes over 21, they lose the game</li>
<li>After the first roll, if the player has not gone bust, they can choose to ‘stand’ or ‘hit’</li>
<li>If they ‘hit’, the dice are rolled again and the player can choose to add the points of either die or the total of both dice</li>
<li>The player must add a score after hitting, even if it means they will go ‘bust’</li>
<li>In the event of a tie, the game goes to the dealer</li>
</ul>
<p>The rules are based on those by <a href="http://www.chessandpoker.com/dice_blackjack.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">James Yates</a></p>
<p>Instead of a big chunk of code I’m going to show you the process of a turn through our good old friend the flow chart. They can be intimidating but I’ve tried to make it in a way that is easy to follow and you should be ale to get a grasp of what the code is doing behind the scenes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There you go, who needs a hundred lines of bolognese when you can have pastel shapes?</p>
<p>Those who played the game may also notice this is the first time I’ve included a computer-controlled opponent, ‘The Dealer’. The dealer is like the player but has the advantages of being able to go second and win in the result of a draw. The dealer’s choice code is as follows:</p>

</div><p>Before this code I run checks that see which options are available after a dealer rolls (these are the DealerCanChoose variables). Here there is a series of conditionals that look at the options and picks the best one for the dealer.</p>
<p>If there is only one option available, then the dealer will pick that one. If there is more than one option available then the dealer will pick whichever will get them the highest score that turn. If there are no options available then the dealer is bust and they will stand. The dealer will also stand if they have a score higher than that of the player. The dealer will continue to roll as long as they are lower than the player and their current score is under 17.</p>
<p>And thats the game! The quickest project I’ve ever done and although its rough around the edges the gameplay is solid and I got to grips with windows form’s implementation of an event-driven program.

<p><strong>Why Such a Simple Game?</strong></p>
<p>Because I wouldn’t have made a game otherwise. You need to affirm any skills in the most basic of games. Even if it kills you making a game so boring, at least you’ve made a game and proved that you can do it. It is an important lesson to learn that you will lose interest in a project and you will have to force yourself to carry on through the mid-development slog. To get around this you have to break a project into stages and set small goals. For instance, while making pong you may set yourself the goal of making a paddle that moves with keyboard inputs and can collide with things, next you might set the goal of making a ball that can bounce off of walls, next a working scoring system and so on. Another important thing to remember is you are almost definitely doing this as a hobby so don’t spend hours forcing yourself to do something you don’t want to do. Sometimes you do have to face it but it is almost always better leaving it and waiting until the next day to finish it when you have a clear head and can be bothered to continue. Burnout can often strike.</p>
<p><strong>Where did you start?</strong></p>
<p>First I only had the idea of making a game in unity, that’s it, so I watched a series by the excellent YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&amp;list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Brackeys</a> that put me on the first step to knowing what I would have to do to make a game. I then decided on pong due to the reasons answered in the previous question. If I got stuck, I consulted the Incredible <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Unity Documentation</a>,  Google or follow a guide by <a href="https://www.awesomeincu.com/tutorials/unity-pong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Awesome Inc</a>. Whilst the guide was necessary for some parts, specifically the ball bouncing, I made sure I did as much as I could with only the Unity documentation and Google searches as I often found on previous years of false starts I would just copy code and not learn anything whereas figuring out these things yourself means you are much more engaged and likely to remember it.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think the game turned out?</strong></p>
<p>As my first serious game, I am pleased. The game could be made more fun with more sporadic ball movements and a single player A.I. The paddle also glitches out slightly if you keep hitting into walls but it was meant to be nothing more than proving to myself that I can make a game in Unity. It has taught me the necessary skills and I have learned from the experience enough to move onto a slightly bigger project (not much bigger). Game development is a game in itself, you start off with a tutorial then make your way up increasingly difficult stages,  you wouldn’t jump into a level 50 area when your only level 5 and you wouldn’t go straight to the glowing sea in fallout 4 when all you’ve got is a is vault jumpsuit and a baseball bat.</p>

    <title>A Game of Two Halves</title>

just with potatoes.”</p>
<p>-Douglas Adams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first videogame I ever played was Crash Bandicoot for the PlayStation One. I spent many an hour running my little orange friend across precarious ledges and away from Raiders of the Lost Ark levels of boulderage.  As is usually the case with videogames during your early childhood, I imagine I didn’t get anywhere near as far as I think. I will never know though as not long into my tenure in videogames I suffered my first casualty. My PS1 and all its saves froze in a pixellated mess on my screen and in the words of John Cleese, “ceased to be”.</p>
<p>As I played more advanced and thought-provoking games I wondered what it would take to make my own and after numerous false starts I  finally made my first game (sort of). The game , Fallen Stars, was made using [Construct 2] (<a href="https://www.scirra.com/%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">https://www.scirra.com/)</a>. Construct is the piece of software that makes making games so easy you can create your first game within a day, rather than programming scripts and dealing with forces you utilise an incredibly powerful ‘drag and drop’ interface with the ability to create some pretty professional looking software. I recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxAjmicdeiU&amp;list=PLRDhcp_8c7uAPQfE6WMBo7PCNlkQIOLdO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">3kliksphilip’s Game Making Journey</a> for an almost videogame origin story as well an explanation of what these types of tools can do. I would thoroughly recommend those who don’t know where to begin to give these prototyping software ago as it is by far the way to get the quickest turnaround of a videogame from concept to executable.</p>
<p>Following my escapades in construct my game making took back seat as I switched to learning more programming languages past the rudimentary python skills gained at age 14 in school and final exams loomed in summer 2018. I furthered my knowledge of python and used websites such as <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Codeacademy</a> to pickup the basics of JavaScript and C#; this is very useful in showing you what all different types of languages there are and the uses of them.</p>
<p><strong>I would like to stress at this moment I only have a basic knowledge of these thee languages. Instantiation is as advanced as it gets at the moment, just wanted to reassure anyone wanting to learn to program that you don’t need to be an expert at all these to get a grasp of what programming is like or in order to get a good base for game development.</strong></p>
<p>Fast-forward to now, summer 2018, and I have time for game development again and I wanted it to more closely link to my programming and software work. I chose Unity as my editor of choice for three reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>It allows me to use the C# skills I had already put the effort in learning.</li>
<li>It seems a lot more accessible than other engines as the structure seems more straightforward and you can get almost all features for free.</li>
<li>It is versatile. You can make both 2D and 3D games for pretty much all platforms.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is with Unity that I went on to make my next game Ping.</p>
