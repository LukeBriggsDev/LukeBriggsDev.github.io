Here are some videos that I enjoyed throughout the year and hope you can get something out of them.
Watch none of them, watch all them too, I hope you find at least one mildly interesting.

# Richard Feynman: The Quest for Tannu Tuva

I have assumed you have seen the excellent Feynman documentary [The Pleasure of Finding Things Out](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p018dvyg/horizon-19811982-the-pleasure-of-finding-things-out).
But I only came across this second documentary from 2 weeks before his death, an extra 44 minutes of Feynman is an excellent way to spent time.

# Peter Capaldi reads a letter from WW1

Christmas themed and a reminder of the time when we had such an esteemed actor playing The Doctor.
A Christmas themed exhibit in the spoken word.

# No More Jockeys

The funniest show in the past year.
I have included a montage of early episodes, but I urge you to seek out the full series to get the true experience.
By watching this show you will get answers to life's deepest questions: What are jobgloves? When does a flight actually start? Who is Mert Aksac?

# Inside No.9

<img src="/static/christmas/2021/inside_no9.jpg" style="width: 50%;" alt="Inside No.9"/>

Seriously, one of the best shows ever made.
It is a dark comedy that strays very much into the dark.
Each series is 6 episodes and each episode is 30 minutes of self-contained stories.
Just watch 1, *just* 1 and see if you like it as much as I do.

[Here is an excellent taster episode. JUST WATCH](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b03w7w6x/inside-no-9-series-1-3-tom-and-gerri)

# James Acaster: Cold Lasagna Hate Myself 1999

The best stand-up show you will ever watch (discounting James' last show [Repertoire](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80213803)).
It is an exploration in anxiety, insecurity, and all them damn chrizzos

# Facts of the year

A selection of Luke facts from the past year:
1. "apple macintosh" is an anagram of "laptop machines"
