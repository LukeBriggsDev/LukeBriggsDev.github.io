# Where Hugo I Go


As you are probably aware, I have redecorated. I said in a [previous post](/inspection-and-dissection-this-site) that my reason for making my own site in the first place was as a central hub to point people to all the things that I do. Despite the fact that from the outside it looks like I haven't done a whole lot since, behind the scenes I have my biggest project yet in development (check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/lukebriggsdev) if you want a sneak preview of that). It was while working on my project that I realised that I should have a site that requires my to ssh into a VPS and pull a git repository every time I want to add a post. 

## Technology
Behind the scenes, the site is hosted on GitHub Pages. The site is generated using a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with a *slightly* tweaked version of the [LoveIt](https://themes.gohugo.io/loveit/).

With a static site I can remove server costs completely, have a better looking site, and make it easier to add new posts.

Because each post is now a document rather than a database field, you can also stick `index.md` at the end of any post to get the raw markdown for that post. You are also able to view the source for the site at [my GitHub](https://github.com/lukebriggsdev/lukebriggsdev.github.io)

## New Logo

Along with the revamped site, I have created a new logo to go with it; it is probably the best looking thing I have ever drawn. The logo takes inspiration from the IBM PCJr with a few more rounded corners, thinner bezels, and a more minimalist feel. 

It was made in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) with the basic shapes and the font is Roboto Mono.
