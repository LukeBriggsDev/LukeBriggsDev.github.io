Here are some videos that I enjoyed throughout the year and hope you can get something out of them.
Watch none of them, watch all them too, I hope you find at least one mildly interesting.

# Cavatina - From *The Dear Hunter*

As Ron Burgundy always says, you have to stay classy, and nothing is as classy as listening to Cavatina on a winter's day.
It is wistfulness in sound waves.

# Stephen Tobolowsky on working with Steven Seagal

What if your action star has a spiritual awakening and has decided he doesn't want to kill people in movies anymore?

# Yoann Bourgeois / CCN2 â€“ Celui qui tombe

An incredible dance performance taking place entirely on a spinning platform.
This may be video that makes me see dance as a legitimate art form.

# Richard Feynman: The Quest for Tannu Tuva

You like Feynman, I like Feynman, everyone likes Feynman. Here's a lesser seen documentary from 2 weeks before his death about his quest to go to a former nation in outer Mongolia.

# No More Jockeys

The funniest show in the past year.
I have included a montage of early episodes, but I urge you to seek out the full series to get the true experience.
By watching this show you will get answers to life's deepest questions: What are jobgloves? When does a flight actually start? Who is Mert Aksac?
