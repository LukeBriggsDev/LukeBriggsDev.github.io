# Full Release: newcastle-bst - Harvard referencing style as recommended by Newcastle University


A couple of months ago I released [a blog post about LateX](/the-laypersons-guide-to-latex).
At the bottom of the post I made quick reference to a BibTeX style I had created for the referencing used by Newcastle University.
The style had a few bugs and was quite hard to find it but it was left dormant while I made some other software and focused on work.

I am now pleased to say that I have spent some work polishing it up, fixing some issues, and giving it a proper release.
It's even on [CTAN!](https://ctan.org/pkg/newcastle-bst).
If you are a student and notice any issues, please report them on [GitHub](https://github.com/LukeBriggsDev/Newcastle-BibTeX/issues)

# Release Notes
## newcastle-bst: Harvard referencing style as recommended by Newcastle University

This package provides a [BibTeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/BibTeX) style to format reference lists in the [Harvard at Newcastle](https://libguides.ncl.ac.uk/managing/harvard) style recommended by Newcastle University. It should be used alongside [natbib](https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib) for citations.

### Installation
The required style file is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/LukeBriggsDev/Newcastle-BibTeX) and [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/newcastle-bst). You can use the style by copying it into your working directory containing your `.tex` file. You can also add it to your bst directory in your tex path to use it without having to copy it over each time.

### Using the style
To use the style include this in your preamble:
```tex
\usepackage{natbib}
\usepackage[UKenglish]{isodate}
\bibliographystyle{newcastle}
```

Also remember to specify your `.bib` file at the end of the document:
```tex
\bibliography{file}
```

The easiest way to create .bib files for this style is through exporting entries from a reference manager such as [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/).
However, some parts are not available through this (such as titleaddon for computer programs).
If you notice any discrepancies between generated references and the recommended styles then please raise this on [GitHub](https://github.com/LukeBriggsDev/Newcastle-BibTeX/issues)
