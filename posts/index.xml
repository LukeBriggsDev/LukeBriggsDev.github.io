            </div><p>There is a very peculiar thing I have found in software development, it is incredibly difficult to actually get software on other people&rsquo;s machines. Even compiled languages can have difficulty.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>I am elbow deep in a very large personal project at the moment (all will be revealed soon) that has so far taken a month. The project is getting to a stage now where deployment methods have to be evaluated. From the beginning I wanted the project to be fully cross platform across Windows, Linux, Mac with a singular codebase. Because of these specific requirements, I went with the <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Qt GUI framework</a>, it is cross platform, runs natively on each platform, and has bindings for Python (my preferred language).</p>
<p>Because nothing is ever easy, there are actually two different python bindings for Qt. There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PySide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">PySide</a> which was created by the Qt Company themselves. It has a less restrictive license, but seems to have less of a community around it due to it being the newer of the two bindings. The other binding is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyQt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">PyQt</a> and came first, even being called <code>python3-qt</code> in the fedora package manager. When it comes down to coding, there is pretty much no difference between them since they are all just pythonic fronts for the same C++ back-end. For the whole project up until recently I was using PySide since it is the same in every way except for a better license.</p>
<h2 id="python-deployment">Python Deployment</h2>
<p>Python, as it is shipped as CPython, does not (by default) compile to machine code. You&rsquo;ll notice a parenthetical and a subordinate clause in the previous sentence, that&rsquo;s how windy this road goes.</p>
<p>There are systems that will turn your python code into binary executables, I was using <a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">PyInstaller</a> to get the job done for me. I&rsquo;d run it on Linux, Windows, MacOS and all my code would be packaged in to binary form; there was the issue of non-python dependencies I had but I could find ways around that. So there I was with all my binaries in a row and feeling confident about how I&rsquo;m going to deploy my application.</p>
<h2 id="linux-binary-woes">Linux Binary Woes</h2>
<p>My current main machine runs Fedora Linux, this is a distribution that is kept reasonably up to date and, at the time of writing, has a new desktop environment and newer kernel than other non-Arch distros. All of this meant that when I tried to run my Linux compiled program on Ubuntu (A major distro I want to support), I get thrown an error that Ubuntu doesn&rsquo;t have the correct version of glibc (the dynamically linked C libraries). Sticking with the standard glibc versions that come with each distro, GNU/Linux is backwards compatible but not forwards compatible. That is to say that a program compiled on an older distro will run on a newer distro but not vice-versa. The solution to this seems straightforward doesn&rsquo;t it? Compile the program on an older version. So I loaded up an Ubuntu LTS VM, compile the program, works like a charm. I try to run that same executable on my main Fedora machine and I get an error message:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span><span class="lnt">2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-cmd" data-lang="cmd">Settings schema &#39;org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings&#39;
does not contain a key named &#39;antialiasing&#39;
</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>The program does not run. This is without doubt a bug in Gnome 40. But it is a bug that happens 100% of the time, it may get fixed, it may not. My application is either incompatible with anything other than my own machine, or compatible with everything <em>except</em> my own machine. Of course I could have two separate binaries, but that would be a bit of a hassle to maintain. In comes what I thought would be my saviour, Flatpak.</p>
<h3 id="build-systems">Build Systems</h3>
<p>Linux has 3 main methods of deploying applications. Shipping binaries, making per distribution packages, and containers (of which flatpak is one). Binaries are, as we&rsquo;ve seen, version dependent, packages are distribution dependent, and containers run across all machines but have extra bulk since they package there own dependencies rather than relying on system libraries.</p>
<p>Throughout my exploration of deployment options, I have made all three. I have documented my results of binaries, and I also went on to make an RPM package (the packaging system that Fedora uses).</p>

</div><p><strong>NOTICE: The above is a script used for testing, it is mostly functional but don&rsquo;t use it as a guide for how to do things properly</strong></p>
<p>The above is a script you feed into <code>rpmbuild</code> and it will generate a .rpm file which Fedora users can use to install your software. You can see that all it really is is some metadata listing app information, dependencies (these dependencies are ones that are inside the fedora packaging system), and a shell script to say what gets installed and how. Because all the dependencies are listed, and are all from the the distros package manager, the file size of an rpm only consists of the files that you supply. In my case it was some python source files and some vector icons, totalling 1.2MB. Of course the full size of the app still needs to be downloaded but the other 150MB or so come in the form of system libraries that other apps can also use. This is the classic Linux method of software deployment, it is lean, and ensures compatibility with a particular distro. The problem comes when looking at other distributions. Some distributions also use RPM (CentOS, RHEL, OpenSUSE) but have different packages, and so need special cases in the file. Other distributions use a different package management system, Debian and derivatives use .deb files for instance.</p>
<h3 id="flatpak">Flatpak</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatpak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Flatpak</a> and it&rsquo;s rival <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_%28package_manager%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Snap</a> aim to solve the dependency hell by shipping everything together in one big package. You avoid incompatibility at the cost of redundancy. The cover image of this post is my flatpak spec file that gets fed into <code>flatpak-builder</code>. And you may notice that it works in a similar way to a distribution&rsquo;s own package manager.</p>
<p>We have metadata along with base dependencies</p>

</div><p>So we are back to the dilemma of using source files or prebuilt binaries, you&rsquo;ll see later that the solution is a mix of both.</p>
<p>One option is just shipping a compiled version of my program in a flatpak. The issue is that flatpak&rsquo;s glibc is once again older than my main machine so <em>all</em> flatpak builds would have to be done in an Ubuntu VM, not ideal. Next up comes building from source in the flatpak. My plan for the process was this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get python and resource files in the flatpak</li>
<li><code>pip install</code> all dependencies</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds simple enough, but flatpak didn&rsquo;t like me communicating with the internet while installing (I tried <code>share=network</code> on individual modules and it didn&rsquo;t work)
So, each python library had to be down as it&rsquo;s own python module with a link to the tar balls on pypi. Flatpak has a tool for such an occasion called <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/tree/master/pip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">flatpak-pip-generator</a>
so the line in the flatpak yml</p>

</div><p>You&rsquo;ll notice that there is no mention of PySide or Qt. The <em>key</em> module that the app depends so heavily is not there, why? Well because both Qt python dependencies are not available as source files from pip. Pip hosts source files and wheels. All the above are source files. These are tar balls that pip will compile and build from source. Wheels are, once again, pre-built binaries. Flatpak doesn&rsquo;t include wheels by default since it wants everything to be as cross platform and cross architecture as possible.</p>
<p>I also wanted to be as platform agnostic as possible so I attempted to build my python bindings from source in the flatpak. Flatpak did not like this. Neither PySide nor PyQt would build and each threw different error during the compilation process. My best guess would by the sandbox does not contain some required system libraries but I am at a loss to know which ones. And C compilers are not the most helpful thing as your only point of reference for a system error.</p>
<h3 id="lasers-to-the-rescue">Lasers to the rescue</h3>
<p>At this stage, I didn&rsquo;t actually know what python wheels were, I just assumed everything had to be built from source. I was desperate for answers after 3 days of debugging and staring at config files. I did something I very rarely do, I used the GitHub search function. To my amazement I found a solution.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.physics.hu-berlin.de/en/qom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Optical Metrology Group</a> in the Physics department of Humboldt University Berlin <a href="https://github.com/hermitdemschoenenleben/linien" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">created a Linux application for locking onto spectroscopy lines</a>. Guess what, they made a flatpak!</p>
<p>I looked at there yaml, and I knew then and there that they had found a solution.</p>

</div><p>They had obviously also faced similar Qt-based problems. Their YAML led to me finding out about python wheels, how I could get PyQt in a flatpak, and how I could tell pip the right directory for a python installation (I had no idea what <code>--target</code> would do before this).</p>
<p>Thanks to some German physicists, my next project is back on track. Beady eyed people may notice some information in some of the config files I&rsquo;ve posted that hint to what it could be. I did try and use PySide using the same wheel method but I got into some strange cyclical versioning thing since it required PySide an Shiboken2 to be installed at the same time. All that means is that my application will be open source out of a legal obligation, as well as an civil one.</p>
<p><em>SIDE:</em> kerberos is also a requirement for PyQt to work in a flatpak, I have no idea why but it may have something to do with certain networking modules.</p>

            </div><p>As you are probably aware, I have redecorated. I said in a <a href="/inspection-and-dissection-this-site" rel="">previous post</a> that my reason for making my own site in the first place was as a central hub to point people to all the things that I do. Despite the fact that from the outside it looks like I haven&rsquo;t done a whole lot since, behind the scenes I have my biggest project yet in development (check out my <a href="https://github.com/lukebriggsdev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">GitHub</a> if you want a sneak preview of that). It was while working on my project that I realised that I should have a site that requires my to ssh into a VPS and pull a git repository every time I want to add a post.</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>Behind the scenes, the site is hosted on GitHub Pages. The site is generated using a static site generator called <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Hugo</a> with a <em>slightly</em> tweaked version of the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/loveit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">LoveIt</a>.</p>
<p>With a static site I can remove server costs completely, have a better looking site, and make it easier to add new posts.</p>
<p>Because each post is now a document rather than a database field, you can also stick <code>index.md</code> at the end of any post to get the raw markdown for that post. You are also able to view the source for the site at <a href="https://github.com/lukebriggsdev/lukebriggsdev.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">my GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="new-logo">New Logo</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Along with the revamped site, I have created a new logo to go with it; it is probably the best looking thing I have ever drawn. The logo takes inspiration from the IBM PCJr with a few more rounded corners, thinner bezels, and a more minimalist feel.</p>
<p>It was made in <a href="https://inkscape.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Inkscape</a> with the basic shapes and the font is Roboto Mono.</p>

<p><a href="https://lukebriggs.itch.io/type-or-die" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Itch.io Link</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the past 5 days I have done what I have failed to do many times before,
complete the process of making a game.</p>
<p>The game was for the NUCATS Game Jam. NUCATS is the Newcastle University Computing
and Technology Society. It was made in Unity (with great help from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Brackeys</a>),
and it was really the first reasonably sized game I&rsquo;ve made. The only other thing I&rsquo;ve ever made in Unity was <a href="/8" rel="">Ping</a>
which, as the name suggests, was a pong clone.</p>
<p>Type or Die is a top-down zombie shooter where it is not about how good
your aim is, but how fast you can type. Waves of zombies come at you in all directions, with the direction
they come from determining what key to press to shoot at them (e.g a zombie coming from the top right would be shot at
using the &lsquo;p&rsquo; key).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The game jam has come in a time between some pretty busy weeks so I have surprised myself by actually getting a
finished game out. I even contemplated not taking part at all after the first day because I felt I just wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it.
I started off (as optimistic idiots often do) full of goals with zero plans. Every step of the way I was decreasing scope
to match my skill and enthusiasm, and its where those paths crossed that the game was made. I knew that the most complex
thing I could make in the time with limited skill was a 2d, single-screen game. Guns are an easy way to make the mundane exciting,
so the game became a shooter, and wanting to have the computer do all the work for you meant that it became a wave shooter for
replayability.</p>
<p>Every waking moment from Monday to Thursday was spent either watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632701/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Suits</a>
or making this game, and the sheer intensity of such an endeavour in the middle of some pretty hectic University team projects
made me realise one thing, I will probably not make another game for a very long time. If you have a gander at my <a href="/projects" rel="">projects</a> page
you will see that all of them are game, so you may think that I really enjoy game-making. But in retrospect I think I only made games as
an outlet for programming rather than an outlet for artistic ideas. Creation is a painful process, so you have to see the purpose in it.
As much as I am proud of what I achieved with each of the games I made, I can&rsquo;t see them as providing a service.</p>
<p>My perspective on games has completely changed in the past year, I place a huge value on the incredible narrative experiences offered by the likes of &lsquo;God of War&rsquo; or
&lsquo;The Beginners Guide&rsquo;, these are games made by people with something to say and the skill to say it. There is certainly a place for arcade
shooters, but if I don&rsquo;t feel passionate about the things I create then I will never see them as worth the time I put into them.</p>
<p>Type or Die marks the end of the 4-year-long adventure that started this whole blog off, I suppose it is fitting that it should end with another
top down arcade shooter. The game is pretty fun, the zombie death animations are my favourite part (also an original theme made by my musically inept hand).</p>
<p>More projects lie on the horizon, and the times they are a changin'.</p>

    <title>Goodbye Windows, I Hardly GNU ya</title>

                <img src="/static/postimages/13/desktop.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p><strong>Preface: I should state that this is not an evangelical sermon, Linux isn&rsquo;t for everyone but it is for me. This is merely a detailing of why I have chosen to switch Operating System</strong></p>
<p>I have, over the course of the past year, consumed pretty much every interpretation and adaptation of Sherlock Holmes out there, from the original works to tangentially linked shows such as the excellent House MD; one thing I have come to understand is that you can only deduce correctly if your initial assumptions are correct. Logic is useless if its underlying axioms are unstable.</p>
<p>So we turn to my current assumption when I use computers &ldquo;Everything must be done in Windows&rdquo;. I have used Windows all my life, all the software I need is on Windows, and all other operating systems are either anaemic in their UX and feature set or are incapable of running on my hardware. It just stands to reason, or does it?</p>
<p>Lets look at that first point, &lsquo;I have used Windows all my life&rsquo;. That is not a very good reason, and the weakest of all. It is indeed true but it shouldn&rsquo;t have any bearing on choice of Operating System, it is an unquestioned ideology rather than any valid argument.</p>
<p>The second axiom, &lsquo;all the software I need is on windows&rsquo;, was probably true for quite a long time. For instance, if I wanted to play any windows games I would have been bang out of luck in days gone by, but tools such as <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Lutris</a> and the strides made in <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">WINE</a> have made that side of things perfectly capable for my needs. Needless to say Mac is straying further away at this point with their move to ARM so the assumption still holds true for them. Outside of gaming, all the apps I <em>need</em> are actually available on Linux. My academic work in Computer Science lends itself perfectly to Linux. All the IDEs I use (the JetBrains suite) are available and the terminal is actually more conducive to my studies compared to the limited Unix-like aliases in the Windows Powershell. The only notable exception on Linux is the lack of the Microsoft Office Suite, but I was quite staggered when I realised that I don&rsquo;t actually have any need for it. My long form writing is now done in LaTeX (<a href="https://www.lukebriggs.dev/17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">see my reasons for that here</a>), and I don&rsquo;t use Excel or PowerPoint. Should the need ever arise, there is the native <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">LibreOffice</a> suite, and the cross platform <a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Google Docs</a>. And if compatibility is a necessity then Microsoft also now offers a web app version of the suite.</p>
<p>The second point links to the third, that other operating systems have terrible UX. The king of UX is obviously MacOS, but that obviously doesn&rsquo;t support my hardware or the ability to run the occasional windows game. I had always perceived Linux as having terrible UX because I always just viewed through the lens of someone who has used Windows their whole life. I always just assumed (once again question your assumptions) that how a Linux distro shipped was how it was. I thought I would have to be stuck with the bland, Ubuntu default GNOME desktop and icons with their washed out colours and pre-iOS 6 style realism. I was completely wrong about this and now we are going to look at where Linux, my new Operating System, is actually better for my needs.</p>
<h1 id="the-linux-way-of-thinking">The Linux way of thinking</h1>
<p>Linux is about what Computers were built to do, and it is about the things that us Computer people love. GNU/Linux is a whole software ecosystem that is far greater than what Windows could ever hope for and only rivaled by what Apple has cultivated on its platforms. Unlike Apple, however, GNU/Linux also offers the user complete freedom in every aspect, and there are levels to this. Yes there are demigods that are compiling their own kernels but because there is such a community driven approach, other people have performed every possible layer of abstraction. Over the decades other people have been putting rungs at all levels of the ladder for other people to step on. Because Linux is built for the community by the community, it doesn&rsquo;t fight me.</p>
<p>If I wanted to change the interface on windows, I would need to install several third party apps, each using their own design language and frameworks all while eating up huge amounts of RAM as they do so. In Linux its as easy as choosing an overall desktop environment you like and customisation is welcomed with open arms as a basic human right. Surprisingly, Linux also has an incredibly consistent design language because of how its built. In Windows you have all sorts of frameworks from many decades that all conflict. You&rsquo;ll go from a UWP app with its tile based design ideas, and then open a WPF app that has a reasonable flat aesthetic and some okay ideas, before finally finding one of your applications uses WinForms with all of its tabs and ugly green loading bars. Almost everything on Linux using either the Gtk or Qt GUI libraries, and because of this everything looks consistent. Most Desktop Environments also let you either make or download your own themes for these graphics libraries. As a result you can make all the colours, buttons and menus in the ENTIRE Linux ecosystem look how you want.</p>
<p>The Linux way is for people who care about these things. If you care about things like the same apps using the same frameworks, or the fact that you can use package managers to allow apps to auto-update and avoid redundant dependencies, or how you have a whole community of people who&rsquo;s only incentive is to make good software.</p>
<h1 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h1>
<p><strong>Distribution</strong>: <a href="https://manjaro.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Manjaro</a></p>
<p><strong>Desktop Environment</strong>: <a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">KDE Plasma</a></p>

<h2 id="why-manjaro">Why Manjaro?</h2>
<p>I chose Manjaro, at first by design and then retroactively I realised that I would have had to go with something like it anyway. I wanted a distribution that didn&rsquo;t come with the usual GNOME look, something that either looked excellent at first glance or had extensive customisation capabilities, and something that was pretty light on what it came with. I ended up narrowing it down to <a href="https://manjaro.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Manjaro</a> and <a href="https://elementary.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Elementary OS</a>. In the end I chose Manjaro between the two because Elementary seemed slightly far behind in its update cycle compared to the Ubuntu it is based off and its never fun to start off with something knowing there is a major version incredibly close. It turned out in the end that Manjaro was really my best choice between the two anyway thanks to its easy switching between Kernels. I currently need to be running the latest experimental kernel for my touch pad to work.</p>

            </div><p>Look at me with a fancy website. We&rsquo;re about to get meta as we discuss how this site you&rsquo;re exploring right now came to be.</p>
<h1 id="why-have-a-website">Why have a website?</h1>
<p>I want something to point to when someone asks &lsquo;so what have you done?&rsquo;. I also need it for when I ask myself the same thing. Sometimes I wonder how much I have actually done in my spare time, and a site like this helps me to remember that I haven&rsquo;t wasted <em>all</em> of my spare time on Minecraft.</p>
<h1 id="why-make-your-own-website">Why make your own website?</h1>
<p>Here in Computer Science land: men are real men, women are real women, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri are real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri; thanks to these huge revelations in the field of existentialism we take it upon ourselves to walk the road already taken.</p>
<p>The real reason is I ought to have side-projects, more than I used to. I have more time, not just because of COVID but also because Computer Science is now the only academic subject I have to pay attention to, whereas most of my time in Sixth Form was spent on Maths and Further Maths. It made reasonable sense for the first project to be a platform for my other projects and this is that platform.</p>
<h1 id="where-did-you-start">Where did you start?</h1>
<p>I knew I wanted to make a website with a Flask back end for 2 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I wanted a back-end that could enable things like logging in and writing blog posts all within the site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I vehemently hate JavaScript and would prefer to do as much with python as possible. In fact this whole site doesn&rsquo;t have any JavaScript. You can inspect element and see that everything front end is done through CSS and HTML; this is certain to change but I will hold out for as long as I can.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For the uninitiated, websites have 2 parts: A front end and a back end. In a simple form, the front end is everything you see (HTML, CSS, JS) and the backend is everything you don&rsquo;t (Databases, Form requests, etc). Flask is a python framework that allows the said language to be used to serve all your requests.</p>
<p>I had used Flask in the past whilst following the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Harvard CS50x</a> course back in 2019 to make a fake stocks app (💎👐). This time round, to re-familiarise myself I followed <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this excellent tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>After you are let loose on your own (especially in web dev) I found you have to have goals and a purpose to what you are doing otherwise it&rsquo;ll never happened. I persevered through the trial-and-error process that is CSS</p>
<p>I used a couple of sites for reference when I was making the design for the sight. These were the sights of: my new friend <a href="https://gwood.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">George Wood</a>, the blog of <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Casey Liss</a>, the blog of <a href="https://marco.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Marco Arment</a>, and <a href="https://hypercritical.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Hypercritical</a> (No prizes for guessing which podcast I listen to).</p>
<h1 id="what-extra-things-have-you-done">What extra things have you done?</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m honoured at your presumption that I go above and beyond in the call of duty. The main thing I have done is make all my posts in markdown. Yes, all my posts are entirely written in markdown which makes me able to write nicely structured documents quickly. The raw text of the markdown is stored as a regular text field in the sqlite database but at the stage when the backend grabs the field from the database, jinja parses it as html using the python module <a href="https://mistune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">mistune</a>. To spice the formatting up even further, since I will be probably be using code snippets, I added the syntax highlighter <a href="https://pygments.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">pygments</a>. In fact here is the code for the highlight renderer being rendered in it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">

    <title>The Layperson’s Guide to LaTeX</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/static/postimages/11/rainbow.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>As part of my degree I will have to write many words into many documents and submit them all as part of assignments.</p>
<p>There was a time when we were young, stupid and thought that the peak of document formatting was WordArt, a drop shadow, and rainbow II. We would stick borders on our .pub files and feel superior if our PowerPoints had a dissolve transition. As we age past primary school we begin to conform to the world’s sensibilities that Comic Sans is not an adequate typeface and having every colour on the spectrum is a way to actually guarantee some of your text will be unreadable.</p>
<p>Since we are forced to conform, we might as well do it to perfection, and you can only go so far in a tool that still thinks that word processors need a background ‘water droplet’ texture fill.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-this-latex-and-why-is-it-not-pronounced-like-that">What is this LaTeX and Why is it Not Pronounced Like That?</h1>
<p>If you want a tool that focuses on the nicest looking documents without caving into the design requirements of 7 year olds, you have to go back to a time before texture fills. Actually you have to go back to a time before computers could even show pictures. Nice looking documents (i.e had legible fonts) had to be obtained using specialised typesetters that cost as much as a house, either that or you’d use a literal printing press – this was the time in which TeX was created. LaTeX is built on TeX and is its more approachable step-son. LaTeX uses a mark-up language to design its document with the idea being that you focus on the content while the engine works out the best formatting.</p>
<h1 id="isnt-this-a-bit-of-a-faff">Isn’t This a Bit of a Faff?</h1>
<p>It depends on your personality. If you are happy with documents that are only adequate, then continue in your mediocrity. But for those of us who seek perfection and see neuroplasticity as a fundamental attribute, LaTeX offers a sterling reward for your efforts.</p>
<h1 id="how-good-does-it-look">How Good Does it Look?</h1>
<p>In the days when people weren’t made of pixels I spent the time making my own word template. It had wonderful serif headings; all the styles used Word’s tools so it did as much of the heavy lifting as possible; and all the font sizes were made just right.</p>
<p>The results from Word are as follows:
</p>
<p>It looks <em>okay</em>. It looks far better than what some people create in Word. Even creating something okay looking feels like a hack though. Having nice paragraph spacing underneath headings required my to individually change all the line spacing options by hand. Anyone who has ever tried to implement code into a word document also knows that it will require you to sacrifice your firstborn.</p>
<p>Now, for a LaTeX document:
</p>
<p>No time spent messing with templates, no changing font sizes, and it probably took me less time to make a document that looks even better. The best thing about LaTeX is that because everything is done programmatically, it can have an integration that is mind boggling. For instance, if you want to insert a segment of a python script in your document you dont actually need to copy and paste bits into your .tex file. You can just tell it where the script is, give it the line numbers and it will display and format it all for you.</p>
<h1 id="where-do-i-begin">Where Do I Begin?</h1>
<p>This is for those of a Windows disposition</p>
<p>First install a distribution of LaTeX called <a href="https://miktex.org/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">MiKTeX</a>. MiKTeX has everything you need and will make the whole experience as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Our code editor is called TeXworks, so open that up and lets write some LaTeX.</p>
<p>LaTeX follows a syntax of \command[option]{parameter} and we start a document off by selecting the type of document we want to create, and then starting and ending said document. There are a number of <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure#Document_classes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">document classes</a> but article is the one recommended for most documents.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Positive gasps emanate from the crowd at the sight of such serifs. You will notice that LaTex automatically added heading numbers and changed the weight, face, and size of the type to better suit a heading. <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">There are all sorts of things you can do</a> that I haven’t covered like how it can do bibliographies for you and organise images and figures correctly. There are also things that are beyond my knowledge like drawing your own 3d graphics within source. All of it can be taken one step at a time. If you don’t know something, look it up, learn how to do it, and implement it – it’s all pretty approachable.</p>
<p>LaTeX isn’t perfect in its implementation, only its possible output. For instance, the answer to the question ‘how do I insert an svg’ is ‘use a pdf instead’ but I hope I have given you a taste of a better alternative to Word, even if it does introduce the possibility that your reports can have syntax errors.</p>
<h1 id="further-notes">Further Notes</h1>
<p>If you are writing your reports in LaTeX like me then you will need the correct bibliography formatting. LaTeX offers a few styles by default but I have learned there is no such thing as a standard and my University (Newcastle) uses <a href="https://libguides.ncl.ac.uk/managing/harvard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">its own guidelines</a>. The process for creating your own style involves both a command line tool and further tweaking using a bespoke programming language using REVERSE POLISH NOTATION, which is what happens if Christopher Nolan got his hands on a compiler. To save my fellow students time, I created a style for Newcastle’s bibliography style and <a href="https://github.com/LukeBriggsDev/Newcastle-BibTeX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">it is hosted on GitHub</a>.</p>

    <title>Inspection &amp; Dissection: Dice-Jack</title>

            </div><p>As part of a course we had to make a game in 2 days that involved random dice and be made as a Windows forms application with Visual Basic. So we had to make a game in something that was the furthest you could get from a game engine with a language I had never used before. But hey, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Rogue</a> was made in 1980 and the graphics had to be ASCII so it could be worse.</p>
<p>The rest of the class generally stuck to the brief with 3 dice that you rolled and you got points for each dot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As you can see, its rather simple. Theres 4 picture boxes, 4 labels, 2 buttons and a listbox. Dice are rolled, the dots are added up and the score is added to the listbox. After 5 rolls the game ends and the player is given their total score. But to know how I added further features we need to look at how this prototype was made.</p>

</div><p>So we have our variables declared in the convoluted VB way. Die1, Die2, and Die3 and the scores for the corresponding dice. DicePoints is the total of those 3 scores and rollcount keeps track of how many times the dice were rolled. Random is just an object we use to generate random numbers</p>

<p>There is also some initialisation code that assigns images and there are event handlers that make the buttons work but this is the main logic.

<p>The following won’t include too many code snippets since it is slightly more extensive (the rushed deadline also means it resembles a tin of Heinz spaghetti in a tumble dryer but we’ll keep that between us)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lets break this down.</p>
<p>First we have a background that was shamelessly made in powerpoint.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The rules, scores, and title are all labels. The bar on the right is made up of the same button and listbox items as before but with its properties edited to change colour, font and border style.</p>
<p><strong>The Rules have been changed to the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to get as close to 21 points without going over</li>
<li>There is a Player and a Dealer</li>
<li>Each contestant has 2 dice</li>
<li>The player goes first</li>
<li>Each dice spot is worth 2 points</li>
<li>If either the player or dealer goes over 21, they lose the game</li>
<li>After the first roll, if the player has not gone bust, they can choose to ‘stand’ or ‘hit’</li>
<li>If they ‘hit’, the dice are rolled again and the player can choose to add the points of either die or the total of both dice</li>
<li>The player must add a score after hitting, even if it means they will go ‘bust’</li>
<li>In the event of a tie, the game goes to the dealer</li>
</ul>
<p>The rules are based on those by <a href="http://www.chessandpoker.com/dice_blackjack.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">James Yates</a></p>
<p>Instead of a big chunk of code I’m going to show you the process of a turn through our good old friend the flow chart. They can be intimidating but I’ve tried to make it in a way that is easy to follow and you should be ale to get a grasp of what the code is doing behind the scenes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There you go, who needs a hundred lines of bolognese when you can have pastel shapes?</p>
<p>Those who played the game may also notice this is the first time I’ve included a computer-controlled opponent, ‘The Dealer’. The dealer is like the player but has the advantages of being able to go second and win in the result of a draw. The dealer’s choice code is as follows:</p>

</div><p>Before this code I run checks that see which options are available after a dealer rolls (these are the DealerCanChoose variables). Here there is a series of conditionals that look at the options and picks the best one for the dealer.</p>
<p>If there is only one option available, then the dealer will pick that one. If there is more than one option available then the dealer will pick whichever will get them the highest score that turn. If there are no options available then the dealer is bust and they will stand. The dealer will also stand if they have a score higher than that of the player. The dealer will continue to roll as long as they are lower than the player and their current score is under 17.</p>
<p>And thats the game! The quickest project I’ve ever done and although its rough around the edges the gameplay is solid and I got to grips with windows form’s implementation of an event-driven program.

    <title>Probably</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>We are currently in a scholarly purgatory. The time between July and
September where you are attached to no institution, have no motivation and
spend months fretting over how your past self will affect your future self
(neither of which do anything for your current self)</p>
<p>At 11 am I received my AS results via e-mail (how modern) and received AAB
+ Distinction. I am happy with this. It’s literally the second-best results I
could have achieved at this point, but there is still an unsettling feeling around
me. Something is gnawing away at me that prevents me from enjoying this now.</p>
<p>During the summer months there isn’t a clear track to follow. No daily
lessons, no scheduled assignments. Any events just seem to be smeared across
what could possibly be discerned to be a date on close inspection. Nothing
tangible appears to be happening in terms of progress for long term goals and
as such there is no certainty.</p>
<p>The longer the time between terms, the more in flux my future appears to be.
I could always fall back on the ‘everything is fine’ mantra but then it feels
as if I’m not striving towards what I want, or that I’m setting myself up for
future regret about not putting in the effort where it needed to be. My mind
runs through permutations of events, “someone probably got 3 As, they’re
the ones who are going to receive your university offer” I feel myself
fretting. I shouldn’t fret, but I do. I know people who failed they’re exams
and they have to repeat a year of their life, they would kill to be in my
situation. There are also people who seem like demigods to me who always get
perfect scores along with having elaborate and incredible side projects. To
some my worries will seem preposterous, to others I will seem I don’t know how
lucky I am. Perhaps I’m both these things and perhaps I’m neither.</p>
<p>But I’m not in their situation, I’m in my situation and can only act within
the context of it. I want to achieve the best possible results I can, and I
didn’t. I wasn’t far off; in fact, I was damn close but it doesn’t matter the distance.
Out of the 216 combinations, I have satisfied 215, and the person inside me
that wanted that last one remains dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Will 1 mark affect whether I get an offer from my preferred university?
Probably not. <em>Probably</em> not. Probably is the most terrifying
word in the English language. There are no certainties in life, everything can
be prefixed with the word probably. Yet we feel the need to stick it
before only a few things, I presume this is to deliberately remind us of the
very large improbability of the task we about to undertake and then
what is the point of even specifying a chance in the first place? Perhaps a
wandering mind is a good sign. I’m not struggling to finance my education
through a side job or agonizing over planning to resist a year, I have a
supportive family and am grateful to my past self for not screwing everything
up terrible.</p>
<p>So. Is everything fine?</p>
<p>Probably.</p>

    <title>Making a Mobile App – Chapter 5: Go Your Own Way</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/static/postimages/9/xkcd378.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><blockquote>
<p>“Real programmers set the universal constants at the start such that the &gt;universe evolves to contain the disk with the data they want .”</p>
<p>xkcd 378</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to add a gallery for users to be able to scroll through a variety of images so I did a quick google search about how I was going to go about it and I found <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-image-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">react-native-image-view</a>. In 6 lines of code and an array of Imgur links you can have a decent and working image gallery, job sorted! Right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In truth, it unsettled me. Was this cheating? Should I have created my own gallery? This package was better than anything I could come up with and something I wasn’t prepared to spend time on but I still felt like a part of the app was no longer mine.</p>
<p>These sorts of ideas are things I have seen keep cropping up across everything I have done. I see other people’s enemy movement packages in Unity and magic code on StackOverflow that does everything you need, but are these a step to far? Are you losing what it means to actuallly create something? I’ve had all these questions and I think I will always question myself about the balance between hard coding everything from scratch and using magic boxes that do the gruntwork for you, but for now I have decided it’s about scope. It is not within the scope of this project to make an image gallery, it is just a small feature in an app that is for doing something else. The amount of time it would take to create something like this is time that could be spent doing something else that is specific to this app and does require the time spent on it.</p>
<p>The way I intend to go about my projects is to learn what I need out of it and the crucial elements of it. If I’m making a game in Unity I would feel uncomfortable using someone else’s movement package, movement is such a core aspect of a game’s feel that I think I should have control over its nuance. Equally, I am ok with using an image viewer package as it means I can spend more time on bigger features and I will write my own image viewer if this one is no longer fit for purpose. This is a pet project and so it is really only my own motivation that is going to get it finished. The more time I spend on a time consuming feature, the less likely it is that the project will get finished. What I want out of this app is to come out the other side of it with something that is complete and to achieve this I need to pick and choose my battles.</p>
