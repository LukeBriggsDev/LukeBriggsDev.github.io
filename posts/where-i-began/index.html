<p>“It can be very dangerous to see things from somebody else’s point of view

<p>As I have said before, my first outreach into programming began with  a GCSE Computer Science course which was cancelled after 7 months for various reasons. Those 7 months were possibly the best way to get a strong foundation of how programming languages work and the general structure in which they follow. The lessons consisted of us being taught a feature (how to do ‘if’ statements, how to call functions, how to cycle through array, etc) and then being given a series of tasks that we had to create a program to complete. The first and simplest of these tasks was Bob’s Change:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Problem:</span>
<span class="sd">Bob would like to buy some sweets, which cost 50p.</span>
<span class="sd">Bob has some money but, unfortunately, Bob is only 3</span>
<span class="sd">and has no concept of money yet. Bob’s solution to this</span>
<span class="sd">is to just hand over the whole of his change and hope the</span>
<span class="sd">shopkeeper will sort it out for him.</span>
<span class="sd">The function bobs_change takes in a number representing</span>
<span class="sd">how much money Bob has handed over (in pence). It should print</span>
<span class="sd">the amount of change owed if he has enough, or</span>
<span class="sd">“Sorry Bob, you don’t have enough” if he is short.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The program would then consist of if statements returning an answer after comparing the money Bob has to the price of a product. For those starting out programming, tests of these kind are a rewarding and fun way of practicing and reinforcing skills that you have learned. When learning a programming language I would strongly suggest using these sorts of tests after learning something new to ensure you both remember that skill better and to also give you a sense of progression as a new programming language can be hard to remember if it goes unused. The rest of the tasks we went through in that course can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/LukeBriggsDev/GCSE-Code-Tasks">here</a>. And an entire assortment of more advanced tasks in many different languages can be found at <a href="https://www.codewars.com">codewars.com</a>.</p>
<p>Really learning a skill and then practicing it is all you need to further your knowledge of programming. Once you have a grasp of basic features, you can then start to make more advanced programs using numerous packages and modules that give you the tools to create graphics and deeper features.</p>
<p>This was how I learned to program. It broke the stages up so I wasn’t daunted by the fact I only knew what for loops were and there was so much more in the language, I only focused on the task and I found with every task I got closer to an understanding where I could begin to realise what could be done and put me on good footing for future projects.</p>
