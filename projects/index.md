# Projects

Here is a list of all my projects that are available on the internet

# Type or Die
------------------
### *Release Date: 5th March 2021*

Made in 5 days for the Newcastle University Computing and Technology Society (NUCATS) Game Jam, in which it received 3rd place.
It is a top-down zombie wave shooter where it's not your aim that matters but how fast you can type.

# Dice-Jack
-------------------
### *Release Date: 23rd September 2019*

Made in 2 days as a mini-project for a course. Used as a way to get to grips with windows forms and learn some Visual
Basic .NET. Just so happens to also be the first game of mine with a computer controlled player.

# Ping!
-------------------
### *Release Date: 23rd June 2018*

A remake of the classic Pong game. This was the first game I programed in Unity and as a result is pretty simple and
isn’t very fleshed out but a vital learning experience in how to make a video-game as well as the the nuances and
functions of the Unity Editor.

# Fallen Stars
------------------------
### *Release Date: 16th April 2017*

This was my first attempt at a video-game and was done well before any other projects. It was made in Construct 2 so no
actual programming was involved but it was the first time I had designed a game from scratch and was a vital learning
experience. It was also a game I did very little of the art for and relied heavily on [opengameart.org](https://www.opengameart.org) which is a great
source of assets for those who are more focused on programming than art.

The game itself is an asteroids clone with a cartoon atmosphere and explosion animations that I was far too proud of at
the time. It even has a (barely) working high score system.
