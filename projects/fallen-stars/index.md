description: My first video game - a clone of asteroids
---

This was my first attempt at a video-game and was done well before any other projects. It was made in Construct 2 so no
actual programming was involved but it was the first time I had designed a game from scratch and was a vital learning
experience. It was also a game I did very little of the art for and relied heavily on [opengameart.org](https://www.opengameart.org) which is a great
source of assets for those who are more focused on programming than art.

The game itself is an asteroids clone with a cartoon atmosphere and explosion animations that I was far too proud of at
the time. It even has a (barely) working high score system.
