I'm Luke Briggs: a Computer Science student from the UK studying at Newcastle University.

#### About Site
This is a site where I will share what I think might be helpful to other people in similar
places in life. Most of the stuff here will be related to side projects, my academic work, and will
be a reference to which I will point to on occasion.

The full story of how this site was created can be found [here](/where-hugo-i-go).
